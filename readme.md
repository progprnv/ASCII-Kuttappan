# ASCII-Kuttappan

**ASCII-Kuttappan** is a fun and interactive Python project that converts live webcam feeds or images into ASCII art in real-time using the power of **Pygame** and ASCII characters. It includes options to customize resolution, contrast, and even supports drag-and-drop for loading images.

## Features

- 🖥️ **Real-time ASCII art** generation from webcam feeds.
- 🖼️ Load custom images and convert them to ASCII art.
- 🎮 Intuitive controls for resolution, contrast, and display.
- 🔤 Customizable ASCII density for detailed rendering.
- 📜 Minimal dependencies and easy-to-run codebase.
