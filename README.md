### Project Description
This project is just turning an ordinary image into a bit interesting ASCII character representation. Its a good design, or just a fun to see the world in a different way.
eg:-
```
TTTTT  i         k
  T       n n n  k k  e e e  r rr
  T    i  n    n kk  e e e e r
  T    i  n    n k k  e e e  r
```

I would like to keep this project open-source. So feel free to fork and further tinker your ideas. I am sure you could have more creative ideas on it. 

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Boring images

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Make it interesting using ASCII

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- Python
- Pygame module

For Hardware:
- Arduino UNO (Plan cancelled)
- POT (Plan cancelled)

### Implementation
For Software:
# Installation
Python should be installed. To install pygame and opencv modules, type the following command in the terminal <br>
`pip install pygame opencv-python`

# Run
Run the main.py file.
For running from terminal, open the terminal in the project directory and run `python main.py`(for Windows) or `python3 main.py`(for MacOS)

### Project Documentation
For Software:
Its a simple app that lets you see your self in ASCII representation. Not only images from camera, you could also open image files, simply draging and dropping. You could alter the size of each charaters of the image by up and down arrow keys. You could play with contrast with left and right arrows. <br>
Download/Clone the project file and experience the world with new eyes. Don't for get to install pygame and opencv modules. I found that it takes a minute or so for the camera to start up. Thus after running the program, patiently wait for a minute, even if any error pops up.

# Screenshots (Add at least 3)

The last screenshort of development

(Actually we also had a plan to include the hardware component mentioned below. We were planning of controlling size and contrast of the image through POT via Arduino. Unfortunately Arduino wasn't communicating with the python program very well. Thus we diched the plan to use Arduino and implemented everything software alone)
